## Overview

**Deepwaita** is a custom GNOME icon theme that combines the vibrant application icons from the Deepin 2022 theme with the clean system and folder icons of Adwaita. This theme was created to provide a cohesive and modern look for GNOME users who appreciate the aesthetics of Deepin's application icons but prefer the simplicity of Adwaita for system elements.

> **Note:** This theme is a personal project and has been tested exclusively on GNOME. It is not officially supported by Deepin or GNOME.

## Features

- **Application Icons:** Utilizes Deepin 2022 icons for a modern and colorful application interface.
- **System Icons:** Falls back to Adwaita for system-related icons such as battery, network, and settings.
- **Folder Icons:** Uses Adwaita's default folder icons for consistency and simplicity.
- **Lightweight:** Designed to be minimal and efficient, ensuring a smooth user experience.
